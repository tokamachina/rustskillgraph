An investigation into the Path of Exile passive tree file format `.psg` from the game's files.

Although we can obtain a javascript object representation of the passive tree from the Path of Exile website, I was curious as to how the tree is represented in the game files. 

This script parses `passiveskillgraph.psg` into a (somewhat) readable representation of the graph structure.
